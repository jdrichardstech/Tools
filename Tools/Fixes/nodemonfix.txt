Broken Nodemon won’t show not installed bad command

javascript - How do I completely uninstall Node.js, and reinstall from beginning (Mac OS X) - Stack Overflow

Apparently, there was a /Users/myusername/local folder that contained a include with node and lib with node and node_modules. How and why this was created instead of in my /usr/localfolder, I do not know.
Deleting these local references fixed the phantom v0.6.1-pre. If anyone has an explanation, I'll choose that as the correct answer.


sudo rm -rf /usr/local/{lib/node{,/.npm,_modules},bin,share/man}/{npm*,node*,man1/node*}

which is the equivalent of (same as above)...

sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/npm /usr/local/share/man/man1/node* /usr/local/lib/dtrace/node.d ~/.npm ~/.node-gyp 


****TO FIND usr/local which is by default hidden:
cli
SHOW HIDDEN FILES:
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES


**** TO Find usr/local
Finder-> Computer->MacHD-> usr/…….


or (same as above) broken down...
To completely uninstall node + npm is to do the following:
1. go to /usr/local/lib and delete any node and node_modules
2. go to /usr/local/include and delete any node and node_modules directory
3. if you installed with brew install node, then run brew uninstall node in your terminal
4. check your Home directory for any local or lib or include folders, and delete any node or node_modules from there
5. go to /usr/local/bin and delete any node executable


You may also need to do:
sudo rm -rf /opt/local/bin/node /opt/local/include/node /opt/local/lib/node_modules
and

sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/npm /usr/local/share/man/man1/node.1 /usr/local/lib/dtrace/node.d


NEXT UNINSTALL NODE:

brew uninstall node

NEXT REINSTALL NODE
-brew install node;
-which node # => /usr/local/bin/node
-export NODE_PATH='/usr/local/lib/node_modules' # <--- add this ~/.bashrc

check for node in brew and for version

now reinstall nodemon globally
npm i -g nodemon
You may have to sudo if you don’t have write permissions
