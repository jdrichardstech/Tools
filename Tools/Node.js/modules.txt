modules are units of functionality for example creating a 
bunch of functions that are bundled up to use later
we use require to load in modules to our files for use



http module: lets us make a web server
fs: module lets us touch files
OS: you can get .userinfo from this module

Node has a lot of built in modules
node.js.org/api shows a list of built in modules


require is a function that is available to you in all of your node files


-----------

inside of all node files we have access to a variable called module.
The only thing we mostly use is .exports which is an empty object;
we can store functions etc inside this object and it will run

real purpose of exports is to export helper functions


using fat arrow function may sometimes lead to errors. if so change to traditional funciton syntax
