2 Core Abilities:

1.  The Ability to quickly master hard things
2.  The ability to produce at an elite level,
    in terms of both quality and speed.

Mastering relevant skills is necessary but not sufficient
You must transform latent potential into tangible results THAT PEOPLE VALUE
The ability to produce is paramount

**IF YOU DON'T PRODUCE YOU WON'T THRIVE NO MATTER HOW SKILLED OR TALENTED YOU ARE**

#To learn hard things quicly, you must focus intensely without distraction.

##Law of Productivity:

**High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)**
