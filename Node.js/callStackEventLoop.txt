The V8 Callstack


-Call Stack is part of V8.
-Call Stack is a Data Structure that keeps track of program execution insided V8
-Keeps track of functions that are executed and statements that are fired
-It is LIFO Last In First Out


Callback Queue is FIFO First in first out

Event Loop Checks the Callback Queue and Call Stack. 
When the Call Stack is empty it moves top function to the Callstack


You never directly interact with these things so it can be a bit confusing.

Execution:

1. Node runs the Main functions...that is the Wrapper function that runs Node





console.log('1. First Console.log Function');

setTimeout(()=>{
  console.log('2. First Written Callback Wait 2 seconds');
},2000)


setTimeout(()=>{
console.log('3. Second Written Callback Wait 0 seconds')
})

console.log('4. Second Console.log function';)
