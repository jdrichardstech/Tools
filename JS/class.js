// Write a class called Point, which represents a point in two-dimensional space. A point has x and y properties, given as arguments to its constructor.

// It also has a single method plus, which takes another point and returns the sum of the two points, that is, a new point whose x is the sum of the x properties of the two original points, and whose y is the sum of their y properties.

// Your code here

// let x = new Point(1,2)
// let y = new Point(2,1)
// console.log(x.plus(y))


// Your code here
class Point{
  constructor(x,y){
  this.x = x;
    this.y=y
  }
    plus(other){
    return new Point(this.x=this.x+other.x, this.y=this.y+other.y)
    }
  
  }
  
let x = new Point(1,2)
let y = new Point(2,1)
console.log(x.plus(y))

  // â†’ Point{x: 3, y: 3}
