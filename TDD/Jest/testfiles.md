2 ways to create test files where they will be seen

1= You can create a dunder test folder (**tests**) and inside that folder you can name the files anything you want and they will be found to run

2= You can create a .spec.js file in the same folder as the compinent and with the same name, it must be the same name, and the testing software will finde it.
