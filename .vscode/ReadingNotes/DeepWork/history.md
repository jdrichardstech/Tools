Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges The Intellectual Life

Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges quote: Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention; let your soul be all intent on whatever it is that i established in you mind as a dominant, wholly absorbing idea.

Brynjojfsson and McAfee emphasize "We are in the early throes of a Great REstructureing"
"Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills an dorganizations are lagging behind"
As intelligent machines imporve, and the gap between machine and human abilites shrings, employers are
becoming moincreasingly likely to hire 'new machines' instead of 'new people'

Brynjolfsson and McAfee's analysis identify 3 specific groups that will thrive lucratively in the new restructuring.

1.  High Skilled Workers: People who are good at working with intelligent machines
2.  The Superstars: With the digital age competition has increased from local to international. The talent market
    is now universally available. People are going to employ the best even if it means leaving the local talent
    pool unemployed sitting in wait.
3.  The Owners: People with capital (Venture Capitalists, Business Owners) to invest in new technologies that are driving the Great Restructuring. Digital technology reduces the need for labor and therefore the proportion of
    rewards returned to the owners is growing. Instagram is a perfect example. They sold for a billion dollars while
    employing only 13 people.
